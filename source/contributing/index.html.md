## Meter Project Contributions

Meter has a number of projects you can contribute to, available at [https://github.com/meterio](https://github.com/meterio).

Some notable projects include:

* [meterify](https://github.com/meterio/meterify): An extended version of `web3` to interact with Meter's RESTful API.
* [Meter NOMP](https://github.com/meterio/meter-nomp): A cryptocurrency mining pool for Meter, written entirely in Node.js.  

## Documentation Contributions

The documentation for Meter uses a static content generator called [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). Slate is primarily for API documentation, but the Meter docs also make use of it for all technical content.

Slate uses Markdown, which makes it intuitive for many people to be able to contribute. The [Documentation Guidelines](documentation-guidelines.html) discusses how to format Markdown documents for Slate according to the Meter standard, and approaches to writing for the Meter documentation.
