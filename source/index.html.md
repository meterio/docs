# Introduction

Meter is a new economic design and consensus protocol for decentralized businesses and finance. Meter's technical foundation builds on battle hardened open source solutions, and extends them in new ways to deliver on the promise of the protocol, and provide a powerful approach to DeFi infrastructure.

## API Documentation

The [API documentation](meterify.html) focuses on the use of the `metrify` library to develop DApps for the Meter blockchain. As a testament to our open source approach, `meterify` extends the well known `web3` library, and much of its relevant open source documentation has been merged with information more specific to Meter.

## Guides and Tutorials

Several guides and tutorials have been written to explain how to work with the Meter blockchain. They cover development topics, such as how to build [DApps and work with smart contracts](meterify.dapps.html), and [mining](mining.html).

## Contributing

You can find a set of [writing guidelines](contributing/index.html) to follow if you wish to add new content, or modify any existing documentation. When you are finished your contribution, submit a merge request and one of the Meter term will review the content and provide any feedback.
